# CHANGES for `env-loader`

## **1.0.7 (2025-05-23)**

**Total rewrite**  - The initial version attempted to create a strongly typed config class object. Due to constraints
in typescripts that made it more of a hassle than simplification, rethink project and create a strongly typed config
object instead - see documentation.
