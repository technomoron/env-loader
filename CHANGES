CHANGES
=======

1.0.10 (2025-11-27)
-------------------

- Added multi-file merge support with `merge: true` (alias: `cascade`): merges
  `.env` files in order with last-win semantics; default still stops at first
  match.
- Allowed subclassing `EnvLoader` by making internals `protected` and having the
  static factories construct `new this(...)` so custom loaders can override
  behavior while retaining full typing.
- Added dedicated merge and subclassing tests to guard the new behaviors.

1.0.9 (2025-10-14)
------------------

- Added Vitest test suite that exercises the source API as well as the published
  CJS and ESM bundles.
- Introduced reusable test helpers for managing temporary `.env` fixtures during
  integration-style specs.
- Ensured the npm clean build pipeline runs without warnings and refreshed the
  generated `dist/` output.
- Validated the published entry points/types by importing the built bundles in tests.

1.0.8 (2025-10-14)
------------------

- Re-published after a failed build/push; code is the same feature set as 1.0.9.
- Verified the release metadata after the pipeline fix.

1.0.7 (2025-05-23)
------------------

- Total rewrite - The initial version attempted to create a strongly typed config
- class object. Due to constraints in typescripts that made it more of a hassle
- than simplification, rethink project and create a strongly typed config
- object instead - see documentation.

1.0.6 (unreleased/notes unavailable)
------------------------------------

- No changelog entry recorded; likely internal changes only.

1.0.5 (unreleased/notes unavailable)
------------------------------------

- No changelog entry recorded; likely internal changes only.

1.0.4 (2025-05-20)
------------------

- Added case-insensitive matching for env keys (normalize and match regardless of casing/underscores).
- Introduced `name` on options to expose custom property names while keeping the env key the same.
- Enhanced `envConfig` inference and validation flow to honor aliases and defaults with safer typing; resolved related TypeScript errors.
- Kept backward compatibility for existing schemas and matches.

1.0.3 (2025-05-20)
------------------

- Made the `type` field optional (defaulting to string) and allowed `default` to accept boolean and string[] values.
- Added strong typing helpers (`EnvOptionType`, `envConfig`/AppConfig) so parsed configs mirror the schema types.
- Tightened `validate` typing (uses schema for inference, partial assignment) and cleaned up parsing/readability without breaking existing behavior.
