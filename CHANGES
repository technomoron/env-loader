CHANGES
=======


1.0.7 (2025-05-23)
------------------

- Total rewrite - The initial version attempted to create a strongly typed config
- class object. Due to constraints in typescripts that made it more of a hassle
- than simplification, rethink project and create a strongly typed config
- object instead - see documentation.

1.0.8 (2025-10-14)
------------------

- See 1.0.9 - build/push script failed.

1.0.9 (2025-10-14)
------------------

- Added Vitest test suite that exercises the source API as well as the published
  CJS and ESM bundles.
- Introduced reusable test helpers for managing temporary `.env` fixtures during
  integration-style specs.
- Ensured the npm clean build pipeline runs without warnings and refreshed the
  generated `dist/` output.

1.0.10 (2025-11-27)
-------------------

- Added multi-file merge support with `merge: true` (alias: `cascade`): merges
  `.env` files in order with last-win semantics; default still stops at first
  match.
- Allowed subclassing `EnvLoader` by making internals `protected` and having the
  static factories construct `new this(...)` so custom loaders can override
  behavior while retaining full typing.
