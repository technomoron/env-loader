# CHANGES for `env-loader`

## **1.0.7 (2025-05-23)**

**Total rewrite**  - The initial version attempted to create a strongly typed config class object. Due to constraints
in typescripts that made it more of a hassle than simplification, rethink project and create a strongly typed config
object instead - see documentation.

## **1.0.8 (2025-10-14)**

- See 1.0.9 - build/push script failed.


## **1.0.9 (2025-10-14)**

- Added Vitest test suite that exercises the source API as well as the published CJS and ESM bundles.
- Introduced reusable test helpers for managing temporary `.env` fixtures during integration-style specs.
- Ensured the npm clean build pipeline runs without warnings and refreshed the generated `dist/` output.
